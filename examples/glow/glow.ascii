  ## Let’s talk about artichokes

  The artichoke is mentioned as a garden plant in the 8th century BC by Homer and Hesiod. The
  naturally occurring variant of the artichoke, the cardoon, which is native to the Mediterranean
  area, also has records of use as a food among the ancient Greeks and Romans. Pliny the Elder
  mentioned growing of carduus in Carthage and Cordoba.

  │ He holds him with a skinny hand,
  │ ‘There was a ship,’ quoth he.
  │ ‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’
  │ An artichoke, dropt he.

  --Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
